# Sovereignbase FAQ

## What is Sovereignbase?

Sovereignbase is a backend and data architecture for building applications without making the application developer the central owner of user data.

Instead of every app maintaining its own canonical database of user information, Sovereignbase lets users own their state through cryptographic Actors. Applications interact with that state through defined resources, permissions, schemas, and protocols.

In simple terms: Sovereignbase helps developers build apps faster while giving users stronger privacy, portability, and control over their data.

## Who is Sovereignbase for?

Sovereignbase is primarily for application developers and product teams.

It is useful for teams that want to build apps without carrying the full burden of managing user data, backend persistence, realtime sync, offline support, authentication, access control, backups, and related infrastructure from scratch.

Users benefit from privacy and data sovereignty, but the first customer is the developer.

## What problem does Sovereignbase solve for developers?

Traditional applications usually require developers to operate a database, define and maintain schemas, manage user data, handle access control, implement sync, build backup systems, secure private information, and carry legal and operational risk.

Sovereignbase reduces that burden. It provides a ready data substrate where user-owned resources can be created, shared, synchronized, backed up, validated, and accessed without the application becoming the ultimate authority over the user’s data.

The developer focuses on the product experience instead of becoming a data custodian.

## Is Sovereignbase just a database?

No.

Sovereignbase is closer to a complete backend substrate than a traditional database. It includes storage, sync, resource discovery, authentication, permissioning, realtime coordination, backup, offline-first behavior, and cryptographic validation.

A database stores application state for the application owner. Sovereignbase stores and coordinates user-owned state for Actors.

## What is an Actor?

An Actor is a cryptographic identity that can own resources, sign actions, authenticate itself, and participate in application workflows.

A user can be represented by an Actor. A device, organization, service, support operator, or application-controlled process may also be modeled as an Actor depending on the application.

Actors are not just accounts. They are cryptographic participants in the system.

## What is a Base Station?

A Base Station is the infrastructure layer that stores, relays, backs up, synchronizes, and helps coordinate resources.

It is not the canonical authority over user data. It does not need to understand or control the user’s private information. Its job is to make the system reliable, available, and connected without becoming the owner of the data.

## If there is no central database, where does the data live?

Data exists first with the user’s Actor and devices. It can also be replicated to peers and backed up to cloud infrastructure in encrypted form.

The important distinction is that the cloud may store encrypted resources, snapshots, deltas, or related metadata, but the user’s Actor remains the authority over the user-owned state.

## Does this mean applications cannot have their own business logic?

No.

Sovereignbase provides the data and trust substrate. Applications can still implement their own business logic, services, workflows, computations, automations, AI systems, or backend services.

The difference is that these services should be modeled explicitly and transparently. If an application needs access to user data, that access should be authorized, scoped, and understandable to the user.

## Can a server also be an Actor?

Yes.

A backend service, organization, support system, analytics worker, AI process, or other service can be modeled as an Actor. That Actor can participate in the system with its own keys, permissions, and defined role.

This allows applications to build server-assisted workflows without abandoning the Sovereignbase model.

## How does Sovereignbase handle privacy?

Sovereignbase is private by default. User data is owned and controlled by the user’s Actor. Private resources can be encrypted, access-controlled, and shared only with authorized Actors.

The application does not automatically get universal access to everything a user owns. Access is modeled through explicit permissions, scoped credentials, and cryptographic authorization.

## How does Sovereignbase help with compliance?

Sovereignbase reduces data exposure by avoiding the traditional pattern where every application becomes the central custodian of user data.

Because data is user-controlled and private by default, applications may have less sensitive data to store, inspect, secure, and retain. Managed Sovereignbase deployments can also provide defined retention, backup, access, and processing policies.

This does not mean developers have no obligations. If an application collects, processes, analyzes, or exports user data, the developer must still be transparent and responsible for that behavior.

## What happens if a user loses a device?

Sovereignbase is not designed around a single fragile device.

A user can have multiple devices, each with secure cryptographic capability. Data can also be backed up to the cloud in encrypted form. The model is that the user’s personal devices and cloud backups work together, while still preserving user control over the actual readable data.

## Does Sovereignbase depend on users remembering passwords?

Not necessarily.

The model can use device-backed security, such as hardware-protected secrets, biometrics, secure enclaves, or similar platform capabilities. The goal is that the user’s cryptographic continuity is anchored in secure devices rather than only in memorized passwords.

## Is Sovereignbase peer-to-peer?

Sovereignbase can use peer-to-peer communication where useful, especially for realtime collaboration and low-latency synchronization.

But it is not only peer-to-peer. It also uses cloud infrastructure for storage, backup, relay, discovery, and fallback. The goal is to combine local-first and peer-first behavior with practical cloud reliability.

## Is Sovereignbase offline-first?

Yes.

Applications can write and operate locally first. Changes can later synchronize to peers and cloud backups. This makes applications more resilient to poor connectivity and reduces dependence on a central server for every action.

## How does Sovereignbase handle realtime collaboration?

Shared resources can be modeled using CRDTs, meaning conflict-free replicated data types. These allow multiple Actors to edit shared state asynchronously while still converging toward valid shared state according to the resource rules.

Where direct connectivity is possible, peers can synchronize directly. Where it is not, Base Stations and relay infrastructure can help route and synchronize updates.

## What are CRDTs used for?

CRDTs are used to represent replicated application state that can be edited independently by multiple Actors and later merged without traditional locking or central write coordination.

Sovereignbase uses CRDT-style resources so that applications can support offline edits, collaboration, synchronization, and eventual convergence.

## Does a CRDT mean any data is accepted?

No.

Sovereignbase is not just “merge anything.” Writes are validated before being accepted. An Actor verifies whether the operation is cryptographically authorized, whether it matches the resource rules, and whether it conforms to the expected schema and policy.

Invalid state should not be accepted into a compliant Actor’s local replica.

## Who validates writes?

Each Actor validates what it accepts.

There is no need to trust a single central authority or a majority of peers. Every Actor can enforce the rules locally before accepting state. If another Actor sends invalid data, the receiving Actor rejects it.

## What happens if a malicious or compromised Actor sends bad data?

Other Actors validate the incoming operation before accepting it. If the operation is not authorized, does not match policy, or violates the schema, it is rejected.

The model is sovereign validation: each Actor protects its own replica before accepting state.

## Is this majority-based consensus?

No.

Sovereignbase does not rely on majority vote for correctness. A compliant Actor does not accept invalid state just because many other Actors sent it.

Every Actor independently enforces the rules it recognizes.

## How are permissions modeled?

Permissions are modeled around Actors and resources.

A resource can define who owns it, who can manage it, who can edit it, who can comment, who can read it, and who can grant further access. These capabilities are cryptographically verifiable rather than merely assumed by a server session.

## Can organizations use Sovereignbase?

Yes.

An organization can be modeled as an Actor or as a hierarchy of Actors and resources. Teams can define ownership, management, roles, access, approvals, audit requirements, and workflows using the same underlying model.

Sovereignbase does not force one governance structure. It provides primitives for building the structure the application needs.

## How does support work if the company does not centrally control user data?

A company can create a support interface where users connect to support operators.

A typical support flow could be:

1. The user opens a support request.
2. The support operator authenticates as an Actor.
3. The user grants scoped, time-limited access to specific resources.
4. The support operator can inspect or act only within that scope.
5. The access can expire or be revoked.
6. The support interaction can itself be logged as a signed, verifiable event.

This gives support access without making permanent, unrestricted backend access the default.

## Can support staff see all user data?

Not by default.

Support access should be scoped, temporary, and granted for a specific purpose. The user can authorize access to the relevant resource or context instead of exposing everything.

## How does debugging work?

For Sovereignbase core resources, debugging should focus on signed operations, resource history, schemas, validation rules, snapshots, and Actor permissions.

For custom application logic, the application developer remains responsible for their own custom behavior. Sovereignbase can provide the underlying authenticated and validated data substrate, but application-specific mistakes still belong to the application.

## What if an app adds custom properties or custom rules?

Then the app developer must define and validate those custom properties and rules.

Sovereignbase can provide predefined schemas and validation for common resource types. If a developer extends the model, they are responsible for enforcing the semantics of that extension.

## How are schema changes handled?

Schema changes should be versioned and migration-aware.

A practical pattern is to support old and new properties during a grace window, normalize on read, migrate state forward where needed, and preserve compatibility for offline or delayed clients.

The goal is that old data can continue to be interpreted safely while the system transitions to newer schemas.

## Can old app versions cause problems?

Sovereignbase applications should be designed so that old clients cannot silently break the system.

Deployment pipelines can force application updates where possible, but offline clients and cached clients must still be considered. The safer model is to use schema versioning, backward-compatible reads, migration logic, and policy checks at the data layer.

## How does Sovereignbase handle analytics?

By default, Sovereignbase does not imply cross-user data collection.

If an application needs analytics, it must model that explicitly. Users can share specific analytics resources with an application Actor, or the application can operate a separate analytics service with transparent disclosure and consent.

The baseline is privacy. Analytics is an explicit application choice, not an invisible default.

## Can developers still build paid applications?

Yes.

Sovereignbase can support payment-integrated applications. Developers can sell access to their app experience, features, services, content, or workflows.

The business model does not need to depend on harvesting user data. Developers can charge for the actual product experience.

## How might Sovereignbase itself make money?

A managed Sovereignbase service can charge developers for usage, for example by authenticated sessions, storage, relay, backup, premium infrastructure, payments integration, or managed deployment features.

The developer then monetizes their own application through subscriptions, purchases, usage pricing, marketplaces, services, or other product-specific models.

## Does Sovereignbase prevent developers from building backend services?

No.

Sovereignbase does not ban backend services. It changes how backend services relate to user data.

A developer can still build external services, heavy computation, AI workflows, automation, indexing, search, reporting, or enterprise integrations. Those services should be modeled as Actors or explicit application services with transparent access to the data they process.

## Can Sovereignbase support search?

Yes, but search must be modeled according to the privacy requirements of the application.

Local search can happen on the user’s device. Shared search can happen over resources the user has access to. Public resources can be indexed. Application-specific search services can exist if users knowingly share the necessary data.

## Can Sovereignbase support public data?

Yes.

Not all data is private. A user or organization can intentionally publish public resources, similar to publishing a webpage or public profile. The key is that publicness is explicit rather than accidental.

## What is data portability in Sovereignbase?

Because data is user-owned by design, portability is a core property.

A user can move data between application contexts, authorize another application to access it, or export it where supported. Applications can understand shared schemas and resource types, making reuse across apps more practical.

## Does Sovereignbase replace every backend?

No.

It replaces a large part of what many apps use a backend for: identity, data storage, sync, permissions, backups, realtime coordination, and user-owned state.

Some applications will still need specialized services, heavy computation, proprietary workflows, or external integrations. Sovereignbase provides the foundation those services can build on.

## What is the simplest non-technical explanation?

Sovereignbase is a way to build apps where your data stays yours.

It helps developers make faster, safer applications without storing everyone’s private information in one big company-controlled database.

## What is the simplest developer explanation?

Sovereignbase is a user-owned backend substrate.

It gives developers storage, sync, auth, permissions, backups, realtime collaboration, and offline-first data without making their app the canonical owner of user data.

## What is the core value proposition?

For developers: build applications without carrying the full burden of user data ownership.

For users: use applications where privacy, portability, and control are built into the architecture.

For businesses: reduce operational, legal, and security exposure while offering better user trust.

## What is the shortest pitch?

Sovereignbase lets developers build apps without becoming the legal, operational, or technical authority over user data.

Users keep sovereignty. Developers get a ready backend model. Applications become faster, safer, and easier to build.
